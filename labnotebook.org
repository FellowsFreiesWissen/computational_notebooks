   :LOGBOOK:
   - Note taken on [2021-01-04 Mo 14:16] \\
     Having a package to take care of all this would be great, but would also mean 
     maintenance, which is not my objective here.
     The objective is actually having a basic workflow of research and documentation, 
     and using the R/Jupyter notebook to navigate it.
