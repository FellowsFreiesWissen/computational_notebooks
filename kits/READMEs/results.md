This folder contains all files of results or their processing, organized in the following subfolders:

`data/raw`: your raw data files. These should not be protected against any change after the first storage

`data/processed`: these are files generated by processing the raw data and these are the ones used in the analysis. It can be a copy of the raw data if that is already ready to use. Any processing of the raw data to generate the files here should be documented in the notebook.

`scripts`: all code used to process the data, and which, for some reason or another is not included in the notebook because they too cumbersome or not of upmost relevancy for comprehension.
