# Computational notebooks to increase productivity and reproducibility in (ecological) research

## A minimal set up to get you started
This repository contains a starter-kit to use so called "computational notebooks" to structure your work.
Computational notebooks are files that contain descriptive text, as well as code and its outputs, in a single, dynamic and visually appealing file (usuallly `.html`, but `.pdf` is also possible).
Using this file to organize your work should facilitate:

- traceability: the file contains all the reasoning behind the study. Moreover, the file formats suggested here facilitate version control, arguably one of the best tools for tracking a project development.
- reproducibility: 
- reporting:  as accompanying pieces for your manuscript to share with co-authors during the development of the work, or to share with reviewers and readers, as supplementary material.

In Figueiredo et al. (_in prep_), we report our reasoning for the kits in this repository and provide examples of implementation.
Below, you can find the basic instructions on how to use it, as well as a video tutorial.

### How to use it
In the [kits](https://github.com/ludmillafigueiredo/computational_notebooks/tree/master/kits) 
folder, you can find a `set_kit` function (in both `R` and `Julia` languages).

By default, calling this function (`set_kit()`) creates:

+ a computational notebook (an `RMarkdown` or `Pluto` file) with a skeleton on how to organize
your computational work

+ a file structure for easy access of relevant files and less wordy code
![file-structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ludmillafigueiredo/computational_notebooks/master/figures/file_structure.png)

The `results` folder contains all files related to data processing: 

- `data/raw`: your raw data files. These should not be protected against any change after the first storage

- `data/processed`: these are files generated by processing the raw data and these are the ones used in the analysis. It can be a copy of the raw data if that is already ready to use. Any processing of the raw data to generate the files here should be documented in the notebook.

- `scripts`: all code used to process the data, and which, for some reason or another is not included in the notebook because they too cumbersome or not of upmost relevancy for comprehension.


The `text` folder contains the main text of the manuscript, folders containing the `figures` and `tables` (unformatted) to be included in it, as well as a folder with the `supplementary` material.

The `submission` folder contains the files specific to journal submissions, e.g. cover letters, submitted versions.

The `set_kit` functions also create the `README.md` files describing the contents of each of the main folders.

The `project_path` argument allows specifying where the folder should be created, and the name of the project folder can be specified with the `project_name` argument.
 
In the [examples](https://github.com/ludmillafigueiredo/computational_notebooks/tree/master/examples) folder, you can find examples of how the notebooks can be used.

## Where to go next
This starter-kit is an attempt to have the simplest, yet effective, reproducible 
workflow for people unfamiliar with the computational practices involved in it.

Once users are comfortable with this set up, they are encouraged to try more complex packages and/or practices, e.g.:

- [workflowr](https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/)
+ [template](https://github.com/Pakillo/template)
- [rticles](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles)
- Organizing your code as an R package: [Han√ü & Baldauf tutorial](https://selinazitrone.github.io/YoMos2020/index.html)
