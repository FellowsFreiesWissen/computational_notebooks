<!-- Submission to PLOS biology could fall into one of the two types of articles (no length limit in either case): -->
<!-- - [...] high-quality tutorials (including multimedia presentations) teaching important concepts in the field of computational biology. -->
<!-- - Software articles describing outstanding open source software of exceptional importance that has been shown to provide new biological insights. -->

<!-- The second option would be Ecography, as a "Software note": Software note articles should be maximum 4000 words in length (main text) and maximum 2 figures, tables or boxes. -->
