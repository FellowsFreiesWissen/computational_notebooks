# Computational notebooks to increase productivity and reproducibility

## A minimal set up to get you started
This repository contains a minimal starter-kit to use computational notebooks as
accompanying pieces for your manuscript and make your analysis reproducible.

In Figueiredo et al. (in prep), we detail and exemplify its use, but for now, here is who it works: 

In the [kits](https://github.com/ludmillafigueiredo/computational_notebooks/tree/master/kits) 
folder, you can find a `set_kit` function (in both `R` and `Julia` languages).

+ this file structure:

+ a computational notebook that structures the workflow around it:

## Where to go next
This starter-kit is an attempt to have the simplest, yet effective, reproducible workflow.
It is simple because it does not introduce new functionality (you need one single function 
to set up), and it is effective because of its simplicity, which makes it easy to use.

Once users are comfortable with this set up, they are encouraged to move to more complex packages, e.g.:

- [workflowr](https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/)
- [rticles](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles)
- Organize your code as an R package: [Han√ü & Baldauf tutorial](https://selinazitrone.github.io/YoMos2020/index.html)
