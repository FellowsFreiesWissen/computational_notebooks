Open science as a form to push for social justice.
Open science does not needs to be publically available, it just need to be

   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2021-01-31 So 22:06] \\
     January 2021: Over the last month, I have re-assessed the use of Jupyter
     notebooks, due to some technical issues regarding the reproducibility of
     such notebooks (Pimentel et al. 2019, Wang et al. 2020). They will still
     be included on the starter-kit, but with a discussion of such issues, 
     workarounds, and alternatives, such as the Pluto package for Julia language. 
     For R code, the best alternative is an RNotebook, for which previous work has
     been done to generate a reproducible workflow, notable in the form of the 
     template package, the drake package, and the Reproducible Research Project
     Initialization. All these projects overlap with my concept of what a notebook 
     should do. My main job is therefore, to combine these tools in a kit that 
     facilitates their use by scientists (biologists and ecologists in particular)
      with limited experience (and time to learn) such computational methods.
          
     In parallel, I have also progressed on Wikimedia's online courses on Open 
     Science, to complete my understanding of Open Science.

      Having a package to take care of all this would be great, but would also mean 
      maintenance, which is not my objective here.
      The objective is actually having a basic workflow of research and documentation, 
      and using the R/Jupyter notebook to navigate it.

#+TITLE: Computational notebooks to facilitate writing and improve 
reproducibility of ecological research

The use of lab notebooks is a a good practice, dating back to ...
Currently, however, most work produced in labs is digital, they are 
not so practical anymore.
The alternative is the use of eletronic notebooks, which overcome this 
shortcoming.
However, the call for open science has yet to be answered by this format.
Here, we present a starter kit to facilitate* the practice of open science based on 
open source software that still allows for secure storage of information.
Although common practice in fields sucha as mathematics and physics (REF),
its application in ecology is still lacking (REF). Therefore, the objective 
os this starter kit is to provide the essential tools for it. We also provide
a discussion on more hard-core practices that can be implemented later.
The kit not only allows the application of open science principles, as it 
facilitates the production of manuscripts, including the figures and 
supplementary materials.
